DESIGN DOCUMENT FOR CELL SIMULATOR SUMMER2017
-Lars Mans√•ker Angelsen



DESCRIPTION:

	A grid based simulation of cells interacting with eachother. Each cell has its own DNA and can evolve over time.
	Some cells should hunt other cells while some absorb sunlight. The cells needs energy to survive and will die after
	a period without it.
	

MODULES:

	CellSim
		Main program, runs all other modules. Including graphics

	World
		Holds all the cells in a grid structure. Has sunlight, obstructions, and random events. The grid contains two pointers, one to a 			cell (if there is one) and what type of place it is. Air/ground/water etc...
		
	
	Cell
		*The cells being simulated. Has DNA, and hopefully a will to live.
		*Some gets energy from sun, some eat other cells
		*Some like to be in dirt, some air, some water
		*Some move, some dont
		*All have energy, which gradually drains.
		*Actions need energy, moving/growing etc.
		
	GENES
		Information about how the cell behaves. Can be inheritet
		*Lifespan
		*Breedingrate
		*Slippery
		*Color
		*Flying
		*Herbavore
		*Plant
		*Algae
		*Prefered growing direction
		*Needs air
		*Needs ground
